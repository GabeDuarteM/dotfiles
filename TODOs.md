# VIM
- See why denite crashes when summoning leader + t on a file with goyo active
- Check Shougo/echodoc.vim
- Open issue on jarvis saying about the coc syntax autoinstall stuff
- Open issue on denite with incompatibility with Goyo
- See if theres a way to write `{` and press enter, and it automatically formats properly
- Make Startify open project with "o", and not only with enter
- Make :q open Startify first, and then if its hitted again, close vim (or something like that).
